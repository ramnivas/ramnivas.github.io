    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Like any new and exciting technology, AOP has generated its fair share
      of buzz, and also its fair share of myths and misunderstandings. After
      following AOP coverage on the Web and listening to the questions asked
      at conferences, I started to see some common themes (or myths) that
      deserve to be cleared up.

      AOP and metadata: A perfect match (March 2005)
    </div>
  <div class="abstract">
    Metadata is a way to express additional information about program
    elements. The new metadata facility in the Java programming language
    enables the use of typed annotations. Using metadata is quite simple,
    although consuming it brings up many choices. Aspect-oriented
    programming presents itself as a principled consumer of metadata. The
    join point model augmented with metadata makes AOP accessible by
    facilitating simpler pointcuts for crosscutting concerns that would
    not be so easily specified by stable signature-based pointcuts.

    <div class="abstract">
      As enterprise systems evolve from concept to code, an otherwise clean
      design can become downright, well, messy, as the practical plumbing of
      logging, caching, transactions, and more infiltrates modules. Wouldn't
      it be better if, say, logging were just another module? Enter
      aspect-oriented programming.

    Aspect oriented refactoring series.  TheServerSide.com (December 2003)
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Refactoring, a process and a set of techniques to reorganize code
      while preserving the external behavior, has gained popularity due to
      its practical value in creating agile code. Recently, aspect-oriented
      programming (AOP) has received increased attention due to its power in
      encapsulating crosscutting concerns in a system through use of a new
      unit of modularity called an aspect. Aspect-oriented refactoring (AO
      refactoring) synergistically combines these two techniques to refactor
      crosscutting elements. In this two-part series, we will examine the
      fundamentals of AO refactoring, the steps involved in the process, and
      a few common techniques.

    </div>
  <div class="abstract">
    Software engineers arealways looking for ways to improve modularity in
    software. Recently, aspect-oriented programming emerged as a new
    modularity technique that aims to cleanly separatethe implementation
    of crosscutting concerns(requirements and design elements that affect
    multiple modules). Several characteristics of AOP work together to
    improve software quality.

    I want my AOP! series. JavaWorld (January-April 2002)
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Most software systems consist of several concerns that crosscut
      multiple modules. Object-oriented techniques for implementing such
      concerns result in systems that are invasive to implement, tough to
      understand, and difficult to evolve. The new aspect-oriented
      programming (AOP) methodology facilitates modularization of
      crosscutting concerns. Using AOP, you can create implementations that
      are easier to design, understand, and maintain. Further, AOP promises
      higher productivity, improved quality, and better ability to implement
      newer features. This article, the first in a three-part series,
      introduces the AOP concept and the problems it attempts to solve.

        Simplify your logging with AspectJ. Developer.com
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      AspectJ simplifies the logging task by modularizing its implementation
      and obviating the need to change many source files when requirements
      change. AspectJ not only saves a ton of code, but also establishes
      centralized control, consistency, and efficiency. Implementing logging
      with AspectJ--a safe and relatively simple task--is a good way to
      learn AOP and AspectJ and to introduce it into your organization. The
      next time you encounter some unexpected problem that occurs
      infrequently, you can use AspectJ-based logging to easily monitor the
      operation log and isolate the problem. Once the problem is fixed, you
      can just as easily remove logging. In this article, we demonstrate how
      you'd use AspectJ in implementing logging. The solution presented here
      builds on the standard logging APIs.

        XML APIs for databases. JavaWorld (January 2000)
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Most Web applications require the presentation of database-generated
      information. XML, because of its ability to separate content from
      presentation, is fast becoming an industry standard for data
      exchange. Most XML tools work with either the SAX or DOM API. This
      article presents a way to blend the power of a database with the
      features of XML. It also provides a simple, pure Java implementation
      of XML APIs for databases that works with any JDBC data source. With
      this approach, XML tools can treat a database as a virtual XML
      document.

        Scripting power saves the day for your Java apps. JavaWorld (October 1999)
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Adding support for user-defined scripting to software tools greatly
      enhances their usability, resulting in higher user satisfaction. With
      the scripting facility, tool users can customize the tool to suit
      their needs, ease their routine tasks, and extend added functionality
      beyond the level intended by the tool vendor. This article presents a
      way to add scripting support to Java applications and provides
      required drivers for four scripting languages: JavaScript, Python,
      Tcl, and Scheme. It also presents a framework that enables support
      for new scripting languages without any changes to the core
      application. Finally, it shows how to add scripting support to those
      Java applications designed without consideration for scripting
      extensions.

        Use nested classes for better organization. JavaWorld (August 1999)
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Top-level nested classes (static inner classes) act like top-level
      classes except they use the enclosing class as a namespace. This tip
      suggests designing supporting classes as top-level nested classes
      inside the primary class. This approach makes the coupling between the
      primary and the supporting classes clear and leads to an
      implementation that is easier to understand, use, and maintain.

    <div class="abstract">
      New methods for training multi-layer perceptron network for forecasting problems are presented.
      The first method exploits spectral characteristics of time series to get faster learning and improved prediction accuracy.
      A neural network scheme for real time implementation of this method is also presented.
      The second method suggests the use of two new weight initialization schemes which give very fast
      convergence besides giving better prediction. The foreign exchange time series is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.
